# DSA Learning Hub Feature

## Overview
The DSA Learning Hub is a comprehensive learning platform integrated into CareerForge that helps users master Data Structures and Algorithms through interactive content display, progress tracking, and structured study plans.

## Features

### 1. Interactive Content Viewer
- **Structured Content Display**: View DSA reference materials and coding patterns as organized HTML content
- **Search Functionality**: Search through topics and descriptions to quickly find relevant content
- **Code Syntax Highlighting**: View code implementations with proper formatting
- **Navigation Controls**: Navigate between topics with previous/next buttons

### 2. Resource Library
- **DSA Sheet**: Comprehensive Data Structures and Algorithms reference
- **Master 20 Coding Patterns**: Essential coding patterns for technical interviews
- **Topic Coverage**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming

### 3. Progress Tracking
- **Topic Completion**: Mark topics as completed and track overall progress
- **Visual Progress Bar**: See completion percentage at a glance
- **Problem Tracking**: Track individual problems within each topic

### 4. 8-Week Study Plan
- **Structured Learning Path**: Week-by-week progression through DSA concepts
- **Problem Recommendations**: Curated list of problems for each week
- **Progress Visualization**: Track weekly completion and overall study progress
- **LeetCode Integration**: Direct links to practice problems

### 5. Quick Links
- **External Resources**: Links to popular coding platforms (LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, Codeforces)
- **Practice Integration**: Seamless transition to practice platforms

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created
1. **DSAViewer** (`src/components/DSAViewer.tsx`)
   - PDF rendering using react-pdf
   - Navigation and zoom controls
   - Error handling and loading states

2. **DSATopics** (`src/components/DSATopics.tsx`)
   - Topic tracking with completion status
   - Difficulty indicators
   - Problem lists with LeetCode links

3. **DSAStudyPlan** (`src/components/DSAStudyPlan.tsx`)
   - 8-week structured study plan
   - Expandable week details
   - Progress tracking and completion celebration

4. **Main Page** (`src/app/dsa-learning/page.tsx`)
   - Resource selection interface
   - Integration of all components
   - Responsive design

### Navigation Integration
- Added DSA Learning to main navigation (Navbar)
- Updated Footer with DSA Learning link
- Added to homepage features section

### Dependencies Used
- `react-pdf`: For PDF rendering
- `pdfjs-dist`: PDF.js worker for PDF processing
- Existing Tailwind CSS for styling
